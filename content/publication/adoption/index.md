abstract: "Based on the trajectory of 274 international airlines on Twitter, we propose a two-stage model to estimate the key drivers in business adoption of social media for marketing and customer service. The findings suggest that a firm's decision-making is subject to both _peer influence_ and _consumer pressure_, and these two factors affect the platform and customer service adoption decisions differently. Regarding peer influence, we show that firms pay close attention to their peers' moves and act correspondingly, as a firm is more likely to adopt the technology when the extent of peers' adoptions increases. We also find evidence of knowledge spillover across firms, where firms are encouraged by positive consumer voices but discouraged by negative voices received by peer firms following their adoptions. Regarding _consumer pressure_, the findings suggest higher volume and sentiment directed at the firm itself positively contribute to both the platform adoption and customer service adoption. Interestingly, while both positive and neutral consumer voices facilitate firms' Twitter adoption, only positive voices contribute to firms' SMCS adoption. "
